# Sneha- Title: Face detection using AI/ML
## Discription: Detecting the faces in images, videos and also in webcam in the most accurate and faster rate. The code is simple and easy to understand and can be developed by any programmer with good knowledge. This code when further enhanced can be used for application such as for security and for attendance in many sectors.
### The programming language used here is python but can also be used with C++ and java
#### Face-detection-image.py: Run this file to detect faces in the given image. You can also use your own image by changing the image name in the code.
#### Face-detection-video.py: Run this file to detect faces in the given video. You can also use yoyur own video by changing the video name in the code.
#### Face-detection-webcam.py: Run this file to detect faces in your own webcam.
##### The problem faced : Here is the angles and expression of the face which is quite difficult to handle for the algorithm and implementing the code.
